1.you can install an IDE for java(eg:MyEclipse 2017) , then directly create a package named "计算器",and put the three java files into 
this package ,the main class is in the Calculator.java ,then open it in the IDE.

2.a more easier way is to install the latest jre (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
use windows CMD to run this
switch the folder directory to where these three java files are
use the commad as follows:
javac Calculator.java EvaluateExpression.java Arith.java
java Calculator
but before that please delete the package statement in the three java files,or there will be errors.
